* From an existing undirected [[type system]]

Given a relation Γ ⊢ T : τ, it's natural to want to derive a type inference
function `infer :: Γ -> Expr -> Type` which has "the same behaviour". Not every
expression has a type though, so we can return a list instead to indicate the
possibility of failure.
